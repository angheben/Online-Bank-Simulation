"""
Hello every one, this project it's a back-end online bank simulation that I've made to train my Python skills, in that
project you are able to deposit money, create, delete, list the accounts and transfer money from accounts too.

This was one of the first projects of mine and was very good to fix how works the Orientation to Objects and some other functions
in a real aplication.
