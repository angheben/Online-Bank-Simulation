"""
Hello every one, this project it's a back-end online bank simulation that I've made to train my Python skills.

This was one of the first projects of mine and was very good to fix how works the Orientation to Objects functionality and some other functions
in a real aplication.

In this project you have all those options bellow to work

    print('Select an option bellow: ')
    print('1 - Create an account')
    print('2 - Make a withdrawal')
    print('3 - Make a deposit')
    print('4 - Make a transfer')
    print('5 - List accounts')
    print('6 - Exit the program')
